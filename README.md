## Summary 

This was like if your parents took you to the pool and tossed you in to learn how to swin, but they threw you off the olympic dive tower.

React is a very deep pool and it was nice to explore as many parts of it as we could in a week and a half. Going from early core concepts like props and state in the early days to writing more complex custom hooks and unit testing at the end, we have come a long way.

This project came with lots of problems, lots of bugs to fix sometimes stemming from being given more liberty in problem solving. Bugs would crop up in the long term from previous solutions that I had thought were valid
